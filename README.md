### DEB-RPM

This is a special branch for namefix deb and rpm packaging setup.

Use `./gen.sh deb` or `./gen.sh rpm` to download the source archive, compile and generate the package.

You will need the [nfpm](https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm) packager used and namefix build prerequisites.
You can use 'nfpm' as second argument to download a nfpm binary and use it instead of system nfpm.
